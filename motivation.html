    <h1>Motivation Letter</h1>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
    <p>

<p>I am writing to you today, hoping to briefly introduce myself and demonstrate my capabilities and achievements within the ever-growing and demanding sector of Computer Science.
I recently finished my education at the University of Debrecen where I have obtained my BSc. in Computer Science. I plan to start my professional career shortly after graduation. My graduation day is 7th February 2020.
</p>
<p>During my studies and training I got to experience the pleasure of working with a team of multi-cultural people and it gives me a pleasure on how to solve different and common problems in a different way and work with people who had different life experiences and that helps me grow not just maturely but professionally, expanding my social circle and opening up my horizons in my professional life, and that pleasure is something I am hoping to encounter again by working for your company. My Internship program is fully integrated into my professional plan and academic background.</p>
<p>The experience I gained during my education and internship would be a valuable tool for my future, as I am interested in pursuing a career in IT.
My undergraduate curriculum in Computer Science at the University of Debrecen introduces me to a wide variety of computer science subjects. Various courses like Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Database System, Software Engineering, Data Structure, and Algorithm, provided me with a strong footing in the theoretical as well as the practical concept of Computer Science. These have assisted me in broadening my knowledge while showing me the diverse side of Computer Science that I find fascinating.</p>
<p>As a fresh graduate in BSc computer science from University of Debrecen, I am aware of the job market of computer scientist which requires both theoretical and practical knowledge, in this regard, I took it upon me to obtain such knowledge
During my studies at the University of Debrecen, Hungary, I had the opportunity to have an internship with RTL group SA in Luxembourg, where I was involved in IT reporting and coordinating with other departments as well as analyzing technical account problems to develop capital expenditure for the company.
Designing and developing websites is one of the things I like doing, this made me work with TEDx Debrecen as a website developer, as a general rule for computer scientist I did coding and modification of TEDx website to make it user-friendly.</p>
<p>As the saying goes some people are born to lead, I could not say no to myself when my natural leadership capabilities arose, I, therefore, became the president of the international student union at the faculty of informatics, as if that is not enough, I was also a mentor and a buddy for stipendium Hungaricum and Erasmus student respectively.
In conclusion, I wish I can write about all the work experiences and leadership skills I have achieved on this noble cover letter unfortunately not. I believe with my work experiences and achievement I am the best candidate for this position. I am most grateful for evaluating my credentials, counting on your usual cooperation.</p><br>

Yours Sincerely,<br>
Abubakar Farouk
