    <h1>Motivation Letter</h1>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
    <p>

I am writing to you today, hoping to briefly introduce myself and demonstrate my capabilities and achievements within the ever-growing and demanding sector of Computer Science.
I recently finished my education at the University of Debrecen where I have obtained my BSc. in Computer Science. I plan to start my professional career shortly after graduation. My graduation day is 7th February 2020.
During my studies and training I got to experience the pleasure of working with a team of multi-cultural people and it gives me a pleasure on how to solve different and common problems in a different way and work with people who had different life experiences and that helps me grow not just maturely but professionally, expanding my social circle and opening up my horizons in my professional life, and that pleasure is something I am hoping to encounter again by working for your company. My Internship program is fully integrated into my professional plan and academic background.
The experience I gained during my education and internship would be a valuable tool for my future, as I am interested in pursuing a career in IT.
My undergraduate curriculum in Computer Science at the University of Debrecen introduces me to a wide variety of computer science subjects. Various courses like Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Database System, Software Engineering, Data Structure, and Algorithm, provided me with a strong footing in the theoretical as well as the practical concept of Computer Science. These have assisted me in broadening my knowledge while showing me the diverse side of Computer Science that I find fascinating.
